## What is the Data Science Initiative?

UCSF Library’s Data Science Initiative (DSI) serves as a campus hub for education and support in data science. Our mission is to build computational and data skills in the UCSF community by providing education and resources to trainees, faculty, and staff. Come learn fundamental research skills, connect with others, and be empowered to engage in cutting edge biomedical research. See the catalog for a list of core Data Science workshops and materials. There are also additional materials online for self-study.
